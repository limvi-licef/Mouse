# Mouse

Welcome to the Mouse project!

Here are the steps to make the project running:
- Clone the project
- Open it with Unity 2020.3.24f1. Unity will inform you that there are errors. Open in safe mode.
- Close Unity
- Open the Mixed Reality Feature Tool (available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/welcome-to-mr-feature-tool).
- Select the directory containing the Assets and so on directories.
- Add the following features: Mixed Reality Toolkit Standard Assets / Mixed Reality Toolkit Foundation / Mixed Reality OpenXR Plugin / WLT Core
- Open the project in Unity. If you do not know how to configure MRTK for Unity, follow the following tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/mixed-reality-toolkit-project-unity/
- Open the Mouse scene
- Run it in the editor or export it to the Hololens. If you run it in the editor, you may enable the "virtual room" gameobject to have a bit of context. However, to have it running with the correct textures, you must install the "High Quality Realistic Wood Textures - Mega Pack" package.
