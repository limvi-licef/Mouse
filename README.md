# Mouse

Welcome to the Mouse project!

Here are the steps to make the project running:
- Clone the project
- Open it with Unity 2020.3.24f1. 
- If not opened, open the Mouse scene
- Install the following dependencies if they are not installed yet: 
-- https://github.com/Yecats/UnityBehaviorTreeVisualizer
-- MRTK 2.x
-- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/high-quality-realistic-wood-textures-mega-pack-75831
-- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/npbehave-event-driven-code-based-behaviour-trees-75884
- Run it in the editor or export it to the Hololens. If you run it in the editor, you may enable the "virtual room" gameobject to have a bit of context. If you export it for the hololens, do not forget to configure the export correctly with the "universal windows platform" (see the section "Configure your project for Windows Mixed Reality" here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/learn-mrtk-tutorials/1-3-exercise-configure-unity-for-windows-mixed-reality?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.azure.beginner-hololens-2-tutorials&tabs=openxr).
